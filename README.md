Automated Flight Booking with Selenium (Java) ðŸš€

Project Overview
This project automates the process of booking a flight on Travomint using Selenium WebDriver with Java. The script navigates through the booking workflow, filling out flight search details, selecting travelers, entering personal information, and proceeding to the payment page.


âœ… Automated Flight Search â€“ Selects departure and destination cities dynamically.
âœ… Dynamic Wait Handling â€“ Uses explicit waits to interact with elements efficiently.
âœ… Form Auto-Fill â€“ Enters user details (name, email, phone, DOB) automatically.
âœ… Scrolling with JavaScript Executor â€“ Ensures visibility of elements before interaction.
âœ… Secure Baggage Selection â€“ Handles additional options like baggage preferences.
âœ… Payment Simulation â€“ Clicks on the "Pay Now" button and cancels the booking for testing purposes.
